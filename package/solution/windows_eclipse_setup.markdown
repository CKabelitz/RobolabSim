## Development with Eclipse on Windows

1. Download Eclipse for C&C++ Developers

2. Start Eclipse and create a new workspace

3. Create a new C project (```File > New > C Project```)

4. In the Wizard choose "Hello World ANSI C Project" and a Compiler which is adequate to your system (in my case MinGW gcc). Additionaly give the Project a nice name =)

5. Build it (small hammer icon) & run it (small green arrow button)

6. If this works your compiler is OK, if not STOP HERE and try to get this to work!

7. Create 2 new subfolders in your src folder named ```h/``` and ```c/```.

8. Copy the 4 files ```Communication.h```, ```Configuration.h```, ```RobotProxy.h``` & ```Urlcode.h``` from the provided ```solution/``` folder in the created h folder.

9. Do the same with the ```*.c``` files and the ```c/``` folder.

10. Delete the auto-created ```.c``` file ```Your_project_name.c``` in your ```src/``` folder (it includes the "Hello World output").

11. FOR THE NEXT STEPS YOU NEED PYTHON INSTALLED

12. Right click on your ```Project > Properties > C/C++ General > Path and Symbols > Includes Tab > GNU C > Add...```

13. Add the python/include path from your filesystem (e.g. in my case ```C:\Python27\include```).

14. Right click on your ```Project > Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > MinGW C Linker > Libaries > plus icon next to "Libaries (-l)"``` .

15. There type ```python27```

16. In the window below click on the plus icon next to "Libary search path (-L)" and add there the path to your python/libs folder (e.g. in my case ```C:\Python27\libs```).

17. It's possible now to build the application (via the hammer icon) and run it (via the green arrow).

Your can now follow the instructions in our README.
